        <h2>WHAT IS A STREETCAR ?</h2>
        <p><em>"A streetcar is a public transportation vehicle (car) that runs on rails laid down on the street. It can also be called a trolley or a trolley-car, and outside North America in English speaking countries it is referred to as a tram or tramcar."</em></p>

                <h2>THE BEGINNINGS</h2>
                <p>In New York around 1830 a young Irishman, John Stephenson, had a brainwave! Why not run a railroad along a street? He developed the idea and the first public streetcar line was opened in New York on November 26, 1832. The cars were hauled by horses.</p>
                <p>The "street railway" idea slowly began to spread. New Orleans ran its first streetcars in 1834, and by the 1880's most major cities in the U.S. and Europe were running horse-drawn streetcars. Their great advantage over horse-drawn omnibuses was the "smooth" ride provided by steel wheels running on steel rails. Bus passengers had a dreadful ride over very uneven and rutted street surfaces.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="text-column">
                <p>Although early streetcars were horse-drawn, other methods of motion were included cable haulage (still in use in San Francisco) and steam haulage (especially in the British Isles and Europe where the cars were actually towed by small steam engines along the streets!) These early modes of traction were soon to become obsolete because of the new miracle of the age - electricity!</p>

                <h2>THE ELECTRIC ERA</h2>
                <p>With the development of the electric motor the streetcar industry was revolutionized and this led to an enormous increase in the number of systems throughout the world. Compared to other modes of transportation, the electric streetcar was fast, frequent, clean, reliable and inexpensive to operate. It provided easy travel to all parts of cities. By the early 1900s virtually every city in North America had a streetcar system, and indeed these contributed to the growth and expansion of many cities.</p>

            <div class="text-column">
                <p>Electricity was normally supplied by an overhead wire system where the cars picked  up the current with a long pole fixed to the roof of each car. This was  simple and relatively cheap to construct as well as being easy to adjust and repair. Later in some areas (especially European cities) the pole  was superseded by a bow collector or a pantograph. In a few cities such  as London and Washington D.C. overhead wires were not permitted in the  central area and a conduit system was used for current collection. It  was picked up by means of a "plough" carried on the truck under the car  and passing down through a narrow slot provided in the conduit fixed  below the road surface.

				Several manufacturers dominated the streetcar industry in North America. Edmonton's first cars were supplied in 1908 by the Ottawa Car  Manufacturing Company, and subsequent orders were placed with the St.  Louis Car Company and the Preston Car Manufacturing Company. Some cities built cars in their own workshops. As well, several companies such as  Brill and Peckham developed different designs of streetcar trucks and  these were supplied to the various car body manufacturers.

                <h2>DECLINE AND THE “PCC” ERA</h2>
                <p>While streetcars were dominant for many  years, the advent of the motor bus and the private automobile led to  stiff competition. To challenge rising costs and falling receipts, a  prototype car of a revolutionary design was unveiled in 1934. This  P.C.C. (Presidents' Conference Committee) streetcar accelerated smoothly instead of jerking from one notch of the controller to the other. The  driver sat at a control console and operated the car by an organ-pedal  accelerator. With lightweight motors and rubber-cushioned wheels the car glided along almost noiselessly. Hopes were high that this new design  would attract riders back to streetcars and challenge bus competition.  By 1940 some 1,100 PCC cars had been built for many of the major  operators in the United States.</p>

                <p>Many cities, including Edmonton, continued to operate electric streetcars  through World War II. Fuel restrictions lead to record passenger loads,  resulting in worn-out cars and tracks. Those cities that had not updated their fleets were now reluctant to make a major capital investment to  rehabilitate their track and rolling stock, the result being that many  systems closed down. (In Europe, apart from the United Kingdom,  streetcars continued to play a major role in public transportation.)  Trolleybus or diesel bus substitution became the order of the day. The  PCC car had arrived on the scene too late to stop the tide of streetcar  abandonment. </p>

                <h2>REVIVAL - THE “LIGHT RAIL” (LRT) ERA</h2>
                <p>By the end of the 1960s a mere handful  of cities in North America (including Toronto) continued to operate  streetcars. The situation in Europe, however, was rather different; the  vast majority of cities retained their streetcar systems. Experiencing  economic recovery and redevelopment after World War II, most of these  cities obtained new streetcars, moved tracks to stretches of private  right-of-way, and in some cases put tracks in tunnels.   These  efficient systems became the forerunners of what we now refer to as  "light rail" or LRT. The flexibility and relatively inexpensive cost of  construction made such systems an attractive alternative to "heavy"  rapid transit subways or metros. This has become the preferred mode of  mass transit for cities with populations below one million. Edmonton was the first North American city to operate an LRT line, which opened in  1978.</p>
